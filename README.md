# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Gain insights into the passenger data of the Titanic disaster and identify patterns that affected survival. The focus is on:
- Visual and statistical exploration
- Feature relationships
- Trends and anomalies

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“Š EDA Techniques

- `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull().sum()` for dataset overview
- `sns.heatmap()` for correlation between numerical features
- `sns.scatterplot()` for Fare vs Age by Survival
- `sns.stripplot()` for Fare by Passenger Class and Survival
- Summary and observations written for each visual

---

## ðŸ“„ Report

- All observations from visualizations are compiled into a **PDF report**.
- Insights cover trends based on Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survival.
- Includes final summary of findings.

## âœ… Outcomes

- Developed strong EDA skills using Python libraries
- Learned to identify meaningful trends and relationships
- Created visual stories from data for better interpretation
